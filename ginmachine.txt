His bunker was stocked with paint he had made.

His root cellar was filled with beets and potatoes. He did not can anything because he did not have any cans. If he did he would inevitably use the can to save gin - and that would surely lead to an unfathmable amount of horror for Jimmy.

It was almost five o'clock. About to take a flight of fancy; to a world where his friends wives, although they love their husbands, all secretly wanted to be with Jimmy - the greatest, most talented man in the history of the world.

Each morning, the gin machine would pour a once a day single ounce shot of heavy sedative, followed by three ounces of esspresso every hour for three hours. The sedative would act as a parachute for the rapidly increasing horror and chaos that was in Jimmy's head. Between the time he woke up and the sedative took full effect, he would search his mind for a new way to get into the chamber that holds the gin machine. Sometimes he would run full speed into the thick steel walls - exuding every ounce of energy he had. Sometimes he would claw at the steel with what was left of his shakey over-bitten fingernails. And in a desparate final attemt to deny the morning-terror a place in his head, Jimmy would scream "KILL YOURSELF! KILL YOURSELF YOU FUCKING IDIOT!! SHOTGUN KILL YOURSELF!" With his violent death as contrast, it dwarfed his terror to bareable - but once the sedative took its effect, Jimmy would settle into the new morning at peace with himself, catch the new hours esspresso in his mug, roll up a fresh smoke, head outside and try again.

Without the sheild of his gin rations, or his dose of heavy sedative to aid in apathy, Jimmy began to feel who he really was. He was shameful, embarrassed - imprisioned in his own self-hatred. And dramatic episodes of suicidal maddness followed.

Each day, Jimmy worked very hard to create his own misery.
